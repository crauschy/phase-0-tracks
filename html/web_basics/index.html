  <h1>Frasier Facts</h1>

    <p>I feel like most TV-watching people that one show that they put on as a comfort. It's usually one they've seen too many times to count. They know the characters by heart, know what happens in which season, and are quick with references to the show in the day-to-day. My comfort show is Frasier.</p>

  <h3>Why Frasier?</h3>
    <p>A friend got me into the show. Before then, I had only seen a few episodes, but she gave me an entire hard drive of movies and series, including all 11 seasons of Frasier. At the time, I was living in Spain, so the American voices, allusions, and humor offered a familiar respite from crossing cultures. It quickly became a habit to watch a few episodes here and there, and I was soon hooked.</p>
