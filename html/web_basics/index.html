  <h1>Frasier Facts</h1>
    <p>I feel like most TV watching people of the world have at least one show that they put on as a comfort. It's usually a show they've already seen too many times to count. They know the characters by heart. They know what happens in which season and offer up way too many references to the show in the day-to-day. For me, that show is Frasier. It was actually a friend who got me into the show of which, until then, I had only seen a few episodes. She gave me an entire hard drive of movies and shows, including all 11 seasons of Frasier. I was living in Spain at the time, and the American voices, allusions, and humor were comfortable and familiar. It quickly became a habit to watch a few episodes here in there, and I was soon hooked.</p>
