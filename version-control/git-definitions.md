# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  > A **version control** program allows one to track the progress of a project, review and revert changes, and create back-ups. It's useful for many reasons. It allows many developers to work on a project simultaneously without stepping on each other's toes or undermining the base code (assuming some sort of code review is happening before merging one's version with the master). It allows programmers to build in save points allowing them to revisit (and perhaps reinstate) an earlier version of code if a problem arises.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
 > A **branch** is essentially a copy of a set of folders/files in a repository (a copy of a project). The default branch in any repository is the *master* branch. New branches are used in order to work on writing new features without messing with the master/base code. One would write and make changes to the appropriate branch (one branch per feature so that many programmers can work simultaneously), creating save points along the way, until all the changes are finished and that feature branch is ready to be merged back into the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?
