# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  > A **version control** program allows one to track the progress of a project, review and revert changes, and create back-ups. It's useful for many reasons. It allows many developers to work on a project simultaneously without stepping on each other's toes or undermining the base code (assuming some sort of code review is happening before merging one's version with the master). It allows programmers to build in save points allowing them to revisit (and perhaps reinstate) an earlier version of code if a problem arises.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?
